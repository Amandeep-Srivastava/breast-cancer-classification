# Breast cancer prediction with Machine Learning

This is a small project to test custom algorithms on the dataset for breast cancer. In this repository you will find necessary information to get you going with 
these 3 classifcation algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes)

## Dataset

This is Wisconsin Dataset for breast cancer but you will find it inside the root folder of this project.

## Install

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.5+

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) 0.18.0
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.10.4
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 1.5.1
> *  [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.17.1

## Code

Each algorithm tested (or version of it) has its own separate .ipynb file. Each file has its name to tell you what algorithm is used.

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that:

For example if yu want to test vectorized version of KNN you should execute one of these 2 lines in your terminal:

`ipython notebook KNN - Vectorized.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook KNN - Vectorized.ipynb`
